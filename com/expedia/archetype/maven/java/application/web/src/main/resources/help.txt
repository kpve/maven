Getting Started Development Sandbox Instructions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Make sure the expedia parent pom is in your local maven repository 
   (com.expedia:expedia-parent).

2) cd target\[new project name]

   mvn clean package -Dstart-webapp

3) Confirm the web app is running by trying the index page:

   http://localhost:9090/
   
   Click on the standard jetty link to get to your app's welcome page:
   
   http://localhost:9090/[new project name]
   
4) cntrl-c in your shell to kill the jetty process running the web app.


Some Useful Maven Commands             Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mvn validate -Dhelp -N                 This ;)

mvn clean package                      Builds the web app including unit tests.

mvn clean package -Dstart-webapp       Builds and starts the web application as
                                       a daemon to the build process. The app's
                                       welcome page is 
                                       http://localhost:9090/[new project name]

mvn clean verify                       Builds and starts the web app, runs 
                                       integration tests and then shuts down 
                                       the web app.
                                       
                                       !!! TODO The archetype's hello world 
                                       integration test is currently failing,
                                       so if anyone wants to help, ahem, 
                                       and fix it that would be great!

mvn clean package -Dinstall-package    Builds the web app and installs the 
                                       application package to the corporate
                                       standard location just like in non-dev
                                       environments.  Look in /expedia/[app name]
                                       for the installed package.  Any web app
                                       container should be able to run the 
                                       war installed there.  Note that this 
                                       uses the package resources in 
                                       the project's external resources module
                                       dev-sandbox package.
                                       
mvn install -Ddependency-support       Copies project dependencies and creates
                                       dependency reports in all modules target
                                       directories.  Very helpful for debugging
                                       api issues with and generating legal
                                       requests for third party apis. 
                                       
                                       !!! TODO The archetype's hello world 
                                       integration test is currently failing,
                                       which blocks this command so if anyone 
                                       wants to help, ahem, and fix it that 
                                       would be great!
                                       
                                       
General maven commands, plugins etc should work.  For more info take a look
at the corporate pom.
