Instructions:

    1) Check out the archetype (assumed to be in location [archetype home] for
       the rest of the instructions.)
              
    2) Run the archetype:

       cd [archetype home] 
       mvn clean validate -Darchetype.new-project-name=[name]
       
       
       NOTE: The archetype depends on the corporate pom com.expedia:expedia-parent.
             If you have network connectivity to expedia-central this dependency
             will be downloaded to your local repository by maven automatically.
             If you do not have network connectivity to expedia-central you can
             check out corporate pom project and build it locally to get it into
             your local repository.

    3) Start using the new project:
    
       copy [archetype home]\target\myProjectName [myWorkspace]\myProjectName       
       cd [myWorkspace]\myProjectName
       mvn validate -Dhelp
       
    4) Follow the help instructions for the new project, that's it :)
